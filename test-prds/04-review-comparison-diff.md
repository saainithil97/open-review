# PRD: Review Comparison View

**Author:** Alex Kim
**Date:** February 2026

## Summary

Add the ability to compare two reviews side by side. This is useful when a PM revises their PRD and wants to see how the review changed — did the score improve? Were the gaps addressed? What new issues appeared?

Users should be able to select two reviews from the list and see a diff/comparison view showing what changed between them. The comparison should highlight improvements and regressions.
